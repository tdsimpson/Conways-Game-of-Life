CISC 352: Assignment 3
April 2, 2018

Conway's Game of Life algorithm is determined by its initial sate, requiring no further input.
It is represented on a grid of cells that are alive (coloured), or dead(white). Every cell interacts
with its neighbours, and changes state depending on four rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
